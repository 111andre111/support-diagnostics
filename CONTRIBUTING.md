Contributing to elasticsearch
=============================

Elasticsearch is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into Elasticsearch itself.

Bug reports
-----------

If you think you have found a bug in this plugin, first make sure that you are testing against the latest version - your issue may already have been fixed. If not, search our [issues list](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-support-diagnostics/issues) on GitHub in case a similar issue has already been opened.

It is very helpful if you can prepare a reproduction of the bug. In other words, provide a small test case which we can run to confirm your bug. It makes it easier to find the problem and to fix it. 


Feature requests
----------------

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in this plugin, check the GitHub issues to see if it was already requested. If not, [open an issue](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-support-diagnostics/issues) on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

Contributing code and documentation changes
-------------------------------------------

If you have a bugfix or new feature that you would like to contribute to this plugin, please find or open an issue about it first. Talk about what you would like to do. It may be that somebody is already working on it, or that there are particular issues that you should know about before implementing the change.

We enjoy working with contributors to get their code accepted. There are many approaches to fixing a problem and it is important to find the best approach before writing too much code.
